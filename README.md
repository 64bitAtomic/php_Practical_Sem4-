12. Write a Web page that asks for the last name of a student. Upon clicking 
"submit", the Web page should call a HTML/PHP script that retrieves student data 
from the database. If the last name does not match any students data, the script 
should indicate "no  match". If the last name does match, then all students 
names  with the given last name should be printed. (For testing, note that both 
Shivam Dwivedi and Shivam Dubey are in the student database.)

13 Write a Web page that asks for the first and last names of a faculty member and a 
phone extension. Clicking "submit" calls a HTML/PHP script that works as follows: 
a. If no names are entered, the script lists all faculty. 

b. If some names or phone information are listed, but these data do not match 
any entries in the direction, the script should indicate "no faculty match". 

c. If some names or phone information are listed and match some directory 
entries, then all matching entries should be printed. For example, during 1998-
1999, both Amit Verma and Sonali Choubey are in  office. Thus, entering 
telephone 3017 (but no name information) should return entries for both of 
these faculty members. 
ans = 13.php

14. Write a Web page that asks for student data, including first name, last name, title, 
email, office, and telephone extension. Upon clicking "submit", the HTML/PHP script

message. Otherwise, the script should insert the data as  a new entry within the 
faculty table.
